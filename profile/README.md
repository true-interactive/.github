**True Interactive** is about unifying and expanding the services in the blockchain / web3 world.

Metaverse as a service. Providing event and community services to increase adoption of web3, innovate existing services, and smooth out and ease the onboarding experience. Tap into the communities in the web2 world that thrive and have a strong loyal fan base and introduce events/services for them that make sense to their community to make that transition. Truly bringing an interactive metaverse to the wider population in whatever form that makes sense to them. 

# Chainlink Spring 2022 Hackathon Submission

For the submission of the project, we will focus on the one element that has contact with a person from start to end. NFT badge/ticket system for the events that ease onboarding, adapts, and dynamically changes itself as time progresses, to the final imprint where it becomes a collectible with attributes now changed to reflect what happened at that specific event.
