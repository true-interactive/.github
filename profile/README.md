# Sum of its Parts

## Bazaar

NFT marketplace only caters to different items that are designed and created by independent artists. Consumers visiting can purchase these can purchase articles of clothing and animation emotes that independent designers created. Tru Interactive will use this platform to encourage artists to contribute 3d models and textures. This will only show items for sale that are usable within the multiverse and designed by Tru Interactive or independent designers.

### Wardrobe    
A personal space dedicated to each person that will house the articles of clothing or animations they own as NFTs. This will allow attendees of events within the multiverse to prepare the customization of their avatar ahead of any planned timeframes.

### Market
Consumers can browse articles of clothing and animated emotes that have been created by independent designers. Only lists compatible items or animations 
with the multiverse. This gives the consumer and designers a single point of trade and does not require searching through multiple NFT markets.

### Studio
Place where designers can upload their designs to view how they would appear within the multiverse
